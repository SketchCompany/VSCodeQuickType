# VS Code Quick Type
This is the official VS Code extension for the official programming language "Quick Type", both of which were developed by us, the Sketch Company.

## Features

Quick Type supports a short time to write something like a function, for example in javascript you would write this:
```
function example(p1){
    console.log("this is an example", p1)
}
```
but in Quick Type you only need to write this:
```
f example(p1){
    log("this is an example", p1)
}
```
This can save a lot of time when writing code! Only beginners should start with a programming language like javascript, becuase it is easier to understand, but
if you already know how programming works, this programming language is perfect for you!

Here's another example, why you should use Quick Type:
```
// you can create constants and variables also very shortly like this:
c constant = {
    key1: "test string"
}
// the code above shows a constant, which contains an object with a key named "key1", which the string "test string" is assigned to

v variable = 100 / 2
// the code above shows a variable, which contains an operation of two numbers "100" and "2", while "100" is being devided by "2".
```

## Requirements

To run Quick Type on your computer, you need to have `Node.js` and the `typescript` package already installed on your computer!

After you've done these steps, you can now install our `Node.js package` by using the `node package manager`.
We recommend, install Quick Type globally on your computer. This can be done with the following command below: 
<br>
`npm install -g quicktype`
<br>

If you only want to install it into your local project, use this command:
<br>
`npm install -D quicktype`
<br>
